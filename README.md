# R_Academic_Project

This was an academic project completed during the FCUP R Course in Data Analytics and Exploratory Data Analysis using a Kaggle IMDB database.

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of R in identifying patterns, generating insights, and making predictions. This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification, and regression techniques applied to the IMDB dataset.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains various attributes related to movies, such as ratings, genres, revenue, and more.

# Project Objectives
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
    - Understand the structure of the data.
    - Identify key trends and patterns.
    - Visualize relationships between different variables.
      
2. Classification:
    - Build models to classify movies into different genres.
    - Evaluate the performance of different classification algorithms.
  
3. Regression:
    - Develop regression models to predict movie ratings and revenue.
    - Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models.

# Libraries Used
- tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.
- dplyr: For data wrangling.
- caret: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- ggplot2: For creating visualizations.
